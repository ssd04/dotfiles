# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dot files I use for my Arch and Ubuntu systems.

The current setup is using: `neovim`, `tmux`, `i3`, and others..
Each config file on the system is a link to the coresponding file in the repo directory.

## Setup

There is a `setup_tools.sh` script that can be used to run the
initial configuration for each tool.

Run with help arg to see the command line parameters:
```bash
./setup_tools.sh --help
```
